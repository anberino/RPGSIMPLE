# simplerpg
An RPG system made to create other RPG systems. Made to be extremely simple, intuitive and easy to use, without having tons of modifiers and complicated die rolls.

Based of ["JoJo's Bizarre Adventure - The RPG", by SB](https://is.gd/JoJoRPG).

Number of times (sessions) tested: 1

This repository contains the current version of simple on PDF. The `Simple.md` file contains the version I'm currently editing and once I feel it has enough additions, I'll post a new version PDF.  The character sheets in PDF are of the current version (1.1.x). If you want to make your own - prettier, better and more efficient - character sheet, follow the info on `sample_sheet.txt`. 

This repository starts at version 1.1.1 because it is when Simple was made public.

If you test Simple and feel like making suggestions (or just want that num), feel free to send me a message.
