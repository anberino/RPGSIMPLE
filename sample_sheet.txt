Sample Simple Character Sheet

The Simple RPG comes with its character sheet. It has all the fields needed by default for a Simple campaign. However, you may choose to create your own sheet, adding extra fields and information. These are the basic fields that are in the default sheet and ideally should be included the one you create, if you choose to do so.
